If the Ford government can't find a crisis to exploit for its right wing privatization agenda, it will manufacture one. We keep hearing the system is “broken", but we have to ask: Who broke it? And if it’s broke, how do we fix it?

Across a wide spectrum of issues; from the Greenbelt to housing, to education workers, to the health care crisis; the Ford government is attempting to stampede Ontarians into changes that will mainly benefit their self-serving Conservative donors and re-write longstanding democratic traditions. All of this because Ford and his minions claim a ‘crisis’ demands immediate action.

To implement their policies, the Ford government has introduced draconian measures such as the ‘notwithstanding clause’, the dictatorial over-riding of municipal democracy, and the casting aside of environmental standards. Ford says these measures are necessary. They are not - we can do better!  
  
Join Peter Tabuns for **Undemocratic and Unethical: Doug Ford’s Conservative Government Erodes our Democracy and Threatens our Environment** - a Zoom-based panel discussion on the actions of the Ford Government and strategies to push back against their schemes.
