**Dear Friend,**

As a previous participant of Sisters of the Roundtable, we invite you to join us on Tuesday, February 28th (at 7 pm) as we welcome five amazing leaders to the stage!

With the City of Toronto's mayoral upheaval and austerity budget on clear view today, the need for progressive and equitable leadership is clearer than ever.

Each of our guests has remarkable stories and insights on gender equity in election campaigns and political bargaining.

## **FEB 28: GENDER EQUITY AND LEADERSHIP: A ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSION**

Join the TYRLC Women's Committee in an early celebration of International Women's Day with a roundtable discussion on Gender Equity and Leadership. The event brings together prominent female leaders in municipal and provincial politics, as well as in the labour movement. The discussion will focus on what leadership truly means and is an opportunity for inspiration and empowerment. Register now to attend in person or online!

**When:** Tue, **Feb 28,** at 7pm-8:30pm  
**Where:** Online & in person at 31 Wellesley St E, Toronto
