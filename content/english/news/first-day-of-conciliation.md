## First day of Conciliation 

Today was a very frustrating day. We did spend more time directly bargaining with the employer & government, due to the participation of the conciliation officer. However it was clear that the focus of the CTA & government was administrative issues in the collective agreement rather than addressing the key topics that directly impact you, your families, your students & your communities.

We will be back at the bargaining table on Tuesday & Wednesday next week.

It has become very clear that this government and our school boards need to see and feel the power building with workers to move them to respond to your proposals which, if accepted, would secure services for students & improve wages & working conditions for each of you.

Your participation in the strike vote is the visible sign of power.
