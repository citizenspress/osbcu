October ,7 2022

This morning, rather than a written response to our reasonable proposals, the government & school boards asked us to make "dramatic & substantial changes" to our bargaining package.

As workers, you have been clear in what your expectations are of the bargaining committee - you need real gains.

In the absence of a serious proposal from the employer we will have reached an impasse in negotiations.

We are still at the table, however, without the government and school boards making a reasonable response to what we have tabled, we will be forced to request a "No Board Report".

We will provide more information, as it becomes available.
