## 1. Introduction

> Purpose: introduce yourself, set the context for the conversation

Hi my name is \_\_\_\_\_! I'm a \[member organizer\]. Have you seen the
latest bargaining update about union contract negotiations?

## 2. Issues & Agitation

> Purpose: what are the 1-2 issues that they want to win in negotiations, that they can only win as a union.

THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP. DO NOT SKIP. 

Use the Summary of Bargaining
Proposals as a hand-out during this 2nd step.

This is going to be a very difficult round of negotiations with a
majority Progressive Conservative government that wants to spend as
little as possible on workers and public education.

You and your coworkers have proposed a real wage increase, better job
security and improvements to working conditions. Meanwhile the
government and council of trustee associations is proposing less than a
\$20/week wage increase when cost of living is going up way more than
that, elimination of your job security, and cuts to your short-term
disability plan.

How have zero and 1% wage increases impacted you? How worried are you
that inflation is 8% and you have already had at least an 11% pay cut in
the last decade?

How would ongoing threats to your job security impact you?

What do you want to improve most about your job?

## 3. Vision & Education

> Purpose: communicate the 'plan to win'
directly connected to the issues they have raised: the only way they can
win is if all education workers are ready to strike if necessary

The first step to winning was to sign a letter to the next premier. The
next step is for you to vote yes in the strike vote when the negotiating
committee announces the vote in September and be ready not to report to
work and to participate in a strike if necessary. When you and all of
your coworkers are ready to strike, it will give you the power to win
\[insert their issue\].

## 4. Call the Question

> Purpose: Ask them if they are prepared to take
action to win on the issues they identified as most important in step
two and vote yes in the strike vote).**

Are you ready to fight for \[talk about their issue, e.g. a real wage
increase\] and vote yes in the strike vote?

If they say yes, ask them to sign Form E -- Application for Strike Pay
and explain to them that to be eligible for strike pay they will need to
have signed Form E and picket 20 hours a week. Give them more
information about when the central strike vote will be held and ask them
to check their email for the ballot to vote.

Confirm their PERSONAL email address and write it on your list --
electronic strike vote ballots will be sent to personal email addresses.

*\[If they say no or unsure, go back to Step #2 and return to their
issues identified in Step #2, e.g. ask them if they are prepared to
accept concessions on sick leave and job security and to have their
wages fall further behind; tell them the truth about what it will take
to win: it isn't possible to win the changes you want to see to your job
without your active participation -- the only way to win a real wage
increase and job security is with worker power -- that means you and all
of your coworkers ready to strike if necessary\]*

## 5. Inoculation

> Purpose: Ask them how the government will respond to
workers building power and discuss how interest arbitration will not win
real wage increases, job security or increases to staffing levels.

What do you think this government will do when they see that you and
your coworkers are getting ready to strike?

They might try to change the rules and limit our right to strike or
legislate terms of our contract like they did in 2019 when they
legislated a 1% wage cap. They might also try to scare you from
striking.

The thing is, we know that arbitrators won't give us real wage increases
or the kinds of improvements you need to job security and staffing. The
only way to win those changes is at the bargaining table and with the
power of workers standing together to say enough is enough.

Here is some more information about why preparing to strike is necessary
to win: give the worker the 1 page handout.

## 6. Work, Assignment

> Purpose: Make a plan with them to speak with
every coworker in their school or family of schools about why it's
important to vote yes in the strike vote; ask them to join the strike
committee or become a picket captain if your local needs to recruit
more

Which of your coworkers can you call to talk about why it is so
important to vote yes in the strike vote? \[Mark the worker's name on
the chart for the coworkers they will talk with and make a plan to
follow up\]

Will you join the strike committee? Become a picket captain? The only
way to win a real increase and job security is with worker power -- this
also means we need a strike committee and \[insert the number for your
local\] of picket captains.
