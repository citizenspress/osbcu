## 2022\[3\] OSBCU Wages Presentation to CTA and Crown

We will walk you through the rationale for our proposal on wages to show why what we have put forward is reasonable, necessary, and affordable.  Our last meeting it was suggested that the employer and crown had concerns about the cost of our proposal. We believe this presentation will demonstrate quite clearly that our proposal is affordable for the province. For our members it is simply not affordable to accept anything that is not a substantial wage increase. A decade of wage restraint has put our members in financial distress. Inflation is high and rising, putting far too many of our members on the brink of poverty.
