My name is Michel Gagnon, originally from the French-speaking region of Kapuskasing. Passionate about nature, I studied as a technician in forestry, fisheries and wildlife management. I worked 10 years as a heavy truck driver in the forestry industry. During the summer months, I spend my free time camping and fishing. In 2004 I came to North bay to start a new job at a secondary school. I was elected as vice-president for 9 months before becoming president of local 4865 for 3 years which covers an area from Parry Sound to Hearst. After attending a few CSCSO conferences, I decided to introduce myself as the French-speaking mobilizer executive of the CSCSO. I am dedicated to representing the rights of Francophone members in Ontario.
