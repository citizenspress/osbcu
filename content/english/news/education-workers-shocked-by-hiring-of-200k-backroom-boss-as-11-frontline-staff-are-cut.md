## **Education workers shocked by hiring of $200K backroom boss as 11 frontline staff are cut**

**Belleville, ON –** In a do-over meeting on Monday, Hastings and Prince Edward District School Board (HPEDSB) trustees adopted the exact same 2022-2023 budget they had declined just last week, this time with a five-to-four vote.

The now approved budget for the next school year starting in September cements previously rejected cuts of 11 frontline workers who directly support students’ success and safety: four custodians, three secretaries, one maintenance worker, one IT technician, one accounting analyst, and the board’s only mail clerk.

These cuts of frontline education workers are happening despite enrollment rising 1.2 percent and the projection that overall funding for this board will increase by 3.1 percent.

Astonishingly, superintendent of business services and board treasurer Nick Pfeiffer explained during Monday’s meeting that funding for a newly created superintendent position, at the added cost of about $211,000 per year, was provided by the Ford government specifically for hiring yet another backroom senior manager.

“Children and their families deserve clean, well-maintained, and safe schools – and this is work that requires people on the job, not cuts to the frontlines or more superintendents,” said Jo-Anne White, president of CUPE Local 1022. “At the same time as this board is laying off the people who actually do the work of supporting students to succeed and keeping students safe, they turn around and hire another overpaid backroom boss. It’s just shocking.”

“Premier Doug Ford and labour minister Monte McNaughton keep repeating surface-thin platitudes about how they’ve turned a new leaf and supposedly support workers,” said Laura Walton, president of CUPE’s Ontario School Boards Council of Unions (OSBCU). “If there’s an ounce of truth to what Ford and McNaughton are saying, they’ll redirect the $200,000 plus that’s going to be spent on another unnecessary backroom boss so the Hastings and Prince Edward District School Board can rescind their cuts and put 11 hardworking people back to work.”

CUPE-Ontario School Boards Council of Unions (OSBCU) members are committed to guaranteeing services for students – services that kids need and their caregivers demand. In 2019, during the frontline workers’ last round of bargaining with the provincial government and school boards, CUPE-OSBCU members negotiated the Education Workers Protection Fund specifically to stop these sorts of damaging cuts that harm students.

The report [Education Workers’ Wages in Ontario: The Impact of Ten Years of Cuts](https://cupe.ca/edge-thousands-cupe-education-workers-share-stories-living-poverty-wages) released this spring found that education workers are the lowest-paid in the sector, earning on average only $39,000 per year. The 11 Hastings and Prince Edward District School Board education workers who are being cut were paid on average just $35,192.
