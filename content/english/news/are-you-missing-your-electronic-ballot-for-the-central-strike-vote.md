## Are you missing your electronic ballot for the Central Strike Vote?

Please follow these steps to ensure your voice is heard.

1\. Check your "other"/"spam"/"junk" folders - the majority of ballots have been located there

2\. Contact your local to see what email was submitted for your credentials - often folks thought a particular email address was being used but it was another

3\. Contact Dots at credentials@dataonthespot.com or call them 1-833-368-7123

Support is available 7 days a week from 8am -8pm EST

Also, please don't worry! We recognized the enormity of the entire membership voting, this is why voting is open for 10 days. Locals will also be doing outreach throughout the 10 days to every member to encourage them to place their vote and support around issues.
