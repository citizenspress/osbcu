## Still Fighting For Your Rights

November 2, 2022

Your OSBCU Bargaining Committee remains at the bargaining table.

To be clear, at this time, the legislation that is on the floor of Queen's Park is not yet law, your rights to job action remain.We will not give up your rights, even in the face of attacks on rights by this government.

We are actively negotiating with the parties - as soon as we have concrete information to share we will. At this time, nothing is concrete.

Please stay connected
