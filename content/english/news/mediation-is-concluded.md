## Mediation is concluded

November 2 2022

This afternoon we were informed that mediation has concluded.

Regardless of the attempts by your OSBCU Bargaining Committee to achieve a negotiated deal that respects the needs of workers, students & families, the Ford Conservative government would not make the necessary investments to achieve this deal.

It is clear that this government never intended to negotiate. The time & effort they have spent on Bill 28, which strips away education worker Charter rights, should have been spent on a deal that would have respected workers & ensured the services that students desperately need are secured.
