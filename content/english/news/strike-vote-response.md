The results are in! 45433 members participated in the OSBCU Central Strike Vote - 82.6%

A Supermajority!

These workers also gave the OSBCU Central Bargaining Committee a 96.5% Yes Vote for the Strike Mandate!

It is clear that not only is worker power growing in our workplaces throughout the province, but that workers are clearly saying YES, to a government and the employers who continue to say NO!

We will return to the bargaining table this Thursday with the strong mandate!
