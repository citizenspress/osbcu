## Important Bargaining Update

November 15 2022

The bargaining team has concluded negotiations for the evening.

A link for an all members meeting at 11am & 6pm has been sent to presidents. We are trying to secure translation. An additional meeting may be added if numbers warrant.

We encourage all members to participate in the meeting to hear full details of the ongoing negotiations.

Please connect with your local president to receive the link.
