The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) has drawn up a list of simple, low-cost ways to reduce
hazards for everyone who spends their days in brick-and-mortar schools. Laura Walton, president of
CUPE’s Ontario School Board Council of Unions (OSBCU), outlined the measures that the union wants
in place in schools that have students attending class:

**Mandatory screening:** Active and enhanced screening should be applied to everyone entering schools.

Screening should include temperature checks for anyone coming through school doors and written
attestation should be required from parents to confirm that their children don’t have symptoms of COVID-
19 and haven’t been exposed to it.
Improving air quality: Better ventilation is crucial for reducing the spread of COVID, but many older
schools have outdated HVAC systems and many newer schools don’t have windows that open. To
mitigate the dangers, air purifiers should be put in every school room that is occupied during the
shutdown, even if this means moving equipment from one school to another.
Reducing mobility of staff: Student cohorts may be smaller, but the education workers who support
them still move from class to class as part of their job. This is dangerous and defeats the purpose of
keeping the same group of children together throughout the school day. Smaller cohorts should the
workers.

Clarify who should still be in school: Among the very few groups of people who should be in schools
during the emergency shutdown are students with high special needs; students whose homes lack
internet connectivity; and the workers who support them. The Ministry of Education must clarify which
workers are required in schools and enforce stay-at-home orders for everyone else.

Review students’ IEPs: Many education workers are in schools and providing direct support to students
who have Individual Education Plans (IEPs). These plans should be reviewed with an eye to safety and
risk assessment to make sure that the right safety protocols are in place to keep everyone safe and
healthy.

“The services provided by frontline educators workers are vital and CUPE members will always be on site
as long as there are students in school to support,” said Walton. “But the provincial government can’t
ignore their concerns about health and safety, especially since both are tied directly to stopping the
spread of COVID-19 in the community.”
