## **$39,000 is Not Enough, for Education Workers or Anyone**

As most families prepare for kids to go back to school next week and with pressure on parents to spend even more out of their own pockets on everything from school supplies to food and rent, you and your 55,000 coworkers are continuing to use the negotiations for your next collective agreement to secure more resources for students, families, and each other.

Your bargaining proposals for Student Success and Good Jobs include a reasonable, necessary, and affordable wage increase of $3.25 per hour that will help retain and recruit education workers to give children what they need in the classroom and pull us back from the brink of poverty.

Listen to your unionâ€™s new radio advertisement, below, and watch videos of some of your co-workers talking about their experiences in their own words on [39000isnotenough.ca](https://39000isnotenough.ca)

The [39000isnotenough.ca](https://39000isnotenough.ca) website is made for parents and members of the public. So please share it with your family, friends, and neighbours.
