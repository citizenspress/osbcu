> Thanks to your display of worker power, your bargaining team is back at the table and Bill 28 will be repealed.
>
> The media is now reporting that an offer of 3.5% and 2% was passed. There are multiple issues with this:
>
> 1) this is not an offer that we have received
>
> 2) we will not accept a 2 tiered wage increase
>
> 3) such an offer would fall short of what you as workers need to ratify a deal
>
> We have been clear, a deal will be made which is a substantial flat rate increase, increases to funding to improve services that CUPE provides and improvements on working conditions.
