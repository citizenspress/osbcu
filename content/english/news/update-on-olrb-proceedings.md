## Update on OLRB Proceedings

November 9 2022

Many of you have inquired about the Ontario Labour Relations Board (OLRB) proceedings that occurred last weekend.

We have received confirmation today that the Unlawful Strike Application filed by the Minister of Education has been withdrawn.

No further actions or steps will be taken in the matter. No decision will be rendered.
