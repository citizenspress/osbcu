October 17, 2022

This morning, CUPE OSBCU recieved the "No Board Report" from the Ministry of Labour.

With the receipt of the report, we now enter into the seventeen (17) calendar day waiting period before we would be in a legal strike position on November 3rd, 2022.

The School Board Collective Bargaining Act (SBCBA) requires that we provide a five (5) day notice prior to commencing any job action.

It is important that as workers, we use this time to build power amongst ourselves, students, families and our communities. Please ensure that your full contact information is with the local union and that you have completed Form E, in order to receive strike pay.
