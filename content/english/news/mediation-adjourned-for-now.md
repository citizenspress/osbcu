## Mediation Adjourned For Now

October 19 2022

We have completed our three (3) days of mediation.

The mediator has concluded that the parties are too far apart and the mediation should be adjourned. He has requested that we reconvene on November 1, 2022 and will be in contact with us prior to us resuming the mediation.

We look forward to you joining us Saturday at 11:30 at the "Hands Off Our Rights" Protest. It is clear that this government needs to see and hear the power of you the workers and the demands that you have.
