## Debbie Popovic, School Librarian

"We are wearing many hats, and our services are being stretched."

Debbie Popovic is an elementary school librarian who works with over 550 students in her school every week. For many students, being in the library and working with Debbie is their favorite thing to do at school. But as student populations grow and schools face devastating budget cuts, librarians like Debbie are struggling to keep up with the work — and their bills.

In September 2021, 51.4% of CUPE education workers reported that they had to work at least one additional job to make ends meet, while 41% have been late making bill payments because their wages are too low to meet their needs. Since then, inflation and underfunding has only gotten worse.

"We care about the students, and hopefully the community will see that. We all want the best for our children."

Workers like Debbie are the backbone of our education system, and they deserve our support. Help us share Debbie's story, and stand up for education workers across Canada who are fighting for a better future for our kids.
