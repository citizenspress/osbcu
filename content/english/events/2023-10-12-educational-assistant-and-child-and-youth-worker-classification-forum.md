OSBCU classifications forums are an opportunity for CUPE education workers from across the province to connect, share, plan and action on issues that they are facing in our schools and worksites. No delegation is required - come ready to learn and grow. 

CUPE Code of Conduct and Equality Statement govern the conduct of these meetings.
