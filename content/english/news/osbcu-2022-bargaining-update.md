## OSBCU 2022 Bargaining Update

October 30, 2022

We have become aware of a statement from the minister being read on media outlets this morning. While we have not received a copy of this statement, representatives from the Ministry of Education have reached out to us to facilitate a meeting this afternoon with representatives from the Council of Trusteesâ€™ Associations, the Crown and ourselves.

We welcome any opportunity for fulsome discussion that will move these negotiations forward. We will continue our practice of transparency and will update you following our meeting.
