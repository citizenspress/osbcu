## Day Two of Mediation Complete

October 18 2022

Your bargaining team has concluded two out of three mediation days.

Unfortunately, at this time we have no improvements or details to report. Your bargaining team remains committed to achieving the gains that you have clearly mandated.

We will return to the table tomorrow morning and will provide additional updates as they become available.

Please join us on this Saturday at 11:30 am for our "Hands Off Our Rights" Protest at Toronto Congress Centre, 650 Dixon Rd, Etobicoke.
