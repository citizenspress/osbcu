**Toronto, ON –** Twenty-four hours before Doug Ford is scheduled to attend the swearing-in of his new cabinet, frontline education workers will deliver tens of thousands of letters to the premier at his Queen’s Park office.

Writing directly to the re-elected premier, frontline workers from public, Catholic, English, and French school boards across the province are calling for increased staffing in schools to guarantee that service improvements for students are in place come September, as well as real wage increases above the rate of inflation to address low pay and problems with retention.

CUPE-OSBCU members will be available for a photo opportunity with banners and boxes of their letters in front of the Ontario Legislative Assembly building at 9:00 a.m.

A report [Education Workers’ Wages in Ontario: The Impact of Ten Years of Cuts](https://cupe.ca/edge-thousands-cupe-education-workers-share-stories-living-poverty-wages) released this spring found that Ontario education workers are the lowest-paid in the sector, earning on average only $39,000 per year. The report relied on new original data – survey responses from more than 16,000 CUPE education workers.

_The Ontario School Boards Council of Unions (OSBCU) unites 55,000 members of the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) who work in the public, Catholic, English, and French school systems throughout Canada’s largest province. OSBCU members are educational assistants, school library workers, administrative assistants, custodians and tradespeople, early childhood educators, child and youth workers, instructors, nutrition service workers, audio-visual technologists, school safety monitors, and social workers._
