The following document is intended for OSBCU members of the Joint Health and Safety Commitee (JHSC) or the Health and Safety Representative (HSR).

This document has two purposes:

1. To evaluate and improve the measures and procedures in place to protect workers from exposure to COVID-19; and
2. Ensure the School Board complies with their requirements under the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OHSA) and the regulations, Ministry of Education Reopening Guides and B-Memos, and Public Health Guidance.


To achieve these purposes, we have provided the following questions (non-exhaustive) to raise if you are meeting with School Board representatives at a JHSC meeting or with a health and safety inspector from the Ministry of Labour, Training and Skills Development. The questions raised are either new requirements or gaps in last yearâ€™s reopening plans.
