The CUPE-OSBCU central bargaining committee, made up of frontline education workers from across Ontario, is currently in mediation with the singular focus of negotiating a collective agreement that meets the needs of students, parents, and workers. We will be limiting our comments to the media while in mediation to better direct our efforts to reaching a freely negotiated agreement.

We respectfully call on the Ford government to make the same commitment, refrain from making comments that distract from negotiations, and spend the time working to get a deal done for student success and good jobs.
