## **CUPE education workers are ready to negotiate a contract that protects and expands services for students**

* The Canadian Union of Public Employees CUPE Ontario School Boards Council of Unions (OSBCU) represents over 55,000 education workers in 600+ different jobs in schools each of whom play a vital role in student success.
* Over the last 4 years funding for schools has been cut by $800 per student (adjusted for inflation). That works out to a cut of $1.6 billion in 2021-2022 alone.
* Cuts to funding mean cuts to services for kids. For example:
  * 

    > 60% of CUPE Educational Assistants provide support to 5 or more students each day, denying students the one-on-one supports they need. Less than 8% of EAs work with only one student.
  * 

    > Many school libraries no longer have library workers to provide supports.
  * 

    > Kids do without the supports of Child and Youth Workers, Psychologists, Social Workers and other professional staff.
* There is no provincial standard for school cleanliness or maintenance. Many school boards cut corners on custodial and maintenance staffing due to underfunding. The repair backlog is over $16.8 billion.
* Over 51% of CUPE education workers have to work a second job to make ends meet.

## **Education workers are demanding improvements for our publicly funded schools including:**

* More education workers to:

  Improve the quality of education

  Better meet the needs of students with increased direct support from Educational Assistants, Designated Early Childhood Educators, Child and Youth Workers, and more

  Keep all school libraries open for students  
  Ensure enough clerical workers to run the school safely and smoothly

  Guarantee healthier cleaning standards and tackle maintenance backlogs.
* Significant wage improvements for all education workers to:

  Keep valued and experienced education workers from leaving the field and to prevent burnout;

  Address the hardship faced by education workers who earn an average of $39,000 per year and have faced a real wage cut of 11% over the last decade due to provincial legislation.
