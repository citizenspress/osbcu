description: "Beginning in April 2022, the Ministry of Labour, Immigration,
  Training, and Skills Development (“MLITSD”) conducted a two-phase awareness
  and enforcement initiative to address workplace violence (“WV”) at Ontario’s
  K-12 School Boards. The enforcement phase of the initiative concluded on March
  31, 2023. "
summary: "MLITSD health and safety enforcement inspectors conducted over 340
  visits to schools and board offices in Ontario. The OSBCU, along with other
  allied unions and associations, collected and charted many of the inspector’s
  field visit reports.  During the initiative, inspectors issued approximately
  114 orders of non-compliance with the Occupational Health and Safety Act
  (“OHSA”), including seven (7) requirements to provide documentation to
  inspectors. Still, we observed many instances where inspectors reported
  non-compliance with the OHSA but refused to issue time-based orders. Instead,
  the inspectors allowed employers to self-comply in the circumstances. "
