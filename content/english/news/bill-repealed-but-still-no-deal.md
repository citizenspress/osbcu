## Bill Repealed but Still No Deal

November 14 2022

The bargaining team has remained at the table since the government announced that Bill 28 would be repealed - today Bill 28 was repealed.

The government’s position has minimally changed since last week.

Our commitment remains to achieve a freely negotiated agreement that respects workers, students and families.

At the request of the mediator we will not be providing a full update until tomorrow.
