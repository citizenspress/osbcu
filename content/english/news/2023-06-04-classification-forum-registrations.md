description: Join your classification to discussing how to continue to grow our
  worker power to address issues moving forward. We need to use our voice all
  the time not just at bargaining!
summary: While the school year comes to a close, the need for continuing to
  build worker power continues!   In our spring forums we will be providing
  space for workers to discuss not only the issues at hand but will be providing
  insight on how to connect with people in our community to build power and
  support beyond our local and provincial spaces.  Learn how to work with your
  trustees and be part of developing campaigns that reflect the needs of your
  classification for the upcoming school year. You can scan the QR codes for you
  classification forum or you can find them on OSBCU social media.
