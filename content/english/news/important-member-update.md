## Important Member Update

The OSBCU Bargaining Team will be bringing a tentative agreement to the membership.

There will be no job action tomorrow. Our members will be reporting to schools to continue supporting the students that we are proud to work with.

Members should watch for more information regarding webinars and ratification vote details shortly. This fight has always been focused on the workers and it is important that workers have a voice on what has been presented.

We will provide further information to our amazing community and labour allies shortly.

Our deepest appreciation for the continuing support
