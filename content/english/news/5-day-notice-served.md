## 5 day notice served

November 16 2022

Despite many late hour attempts to achieve a freely negotiated settlement talks have again broke down and the difficult decision was made to serve the 5 day notice of strike to the Council of Trustees Association & Government.

The OSBCU remains focused on not only achieving a deal that provides workers with a livable wage but ensures that the services that students need are improved and protected.

We remain committed to reaching a fair settlement prior to November 21, 2022.
