## _A statement from CUPE’s Ontario School Boards Council of Unions (OSBCU) central bargaining committee:_

_“We remain hard at work doing everything we can to get the best deal for students, families, and frontline education workers._

_“Education workers’ central bargaining committee is still at the table and expects to be here well into the evening. We’re buoyed by everyone who braved the cold to show solidarity at 11 rallies across the province today, standing together to urge the Ford government to make much-needed investments in your schools._

_“While we hope a strike won’t be necessary, we’re committed to giving parents as much notice as possible of any job action. We continue to encourage the government to avert a strike by funding investments that would ensure there are enough staff to provide in-school services which students and parents rely on.”_
