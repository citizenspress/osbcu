As of 5pm tonight, your OSBCU bargaining team has requested a "No Board report"

A No Board report is the next step in the legal bargaining process and a requirement prior to reaching a legal strike position. We will be providing you with ample notice of when job action could commence in accordance with legislation.

We are calling on the government & employers to provide more dates in order to reach a negotiated settlement - that is the best plan for all parties. We are available to meet at any time.

It is time for them to get serious & respect your demands. Students & families deserve guarantees of staffing levels & services and you, as workers deserve a significant wage increase.

Your voice has been heard by your bargaining team - we will continue to amplify it at the table & encourage you to use it within your community.
